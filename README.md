# Wild Rydes Serverless Web Application Workshop

## Introduction

![Wild Rydes](images/wildrydes.png)

[Wild Rydes][wildrydes] needs your help! With fresh funding from its seed investors, Wild Rydes is seeking to build the world’s greatest mobile/VR/AR unicorn transportation system. The scrappy startup needs a first-class webpage to begin marketing to new users and to begin its plans for global domination. Join us to help Wild Rydes build a website using a serverless architecture.

## Overview of Workshop Labs

The Wild Rydes Serverless Web Application Workshop introduces the basics of building serverless web applications using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Cognito, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), Amazon CloudFront, and other AWS services. In this workshop, you are an early founding employee of Wild Rydes who is tasked with building out the company’s marketing website and other initiatives using a serverless architecture and AWS.

### Requirements

You'll be configuring serverless solutions in your own AWS account. All of the services required for this lab are covered under the [AWS Free Tier][free-tier] for accounts that were created within the past 12 months. Accounts that have been created within the last 24 hours might not yet have access to servers required for this workshop.

To complete this lab, you'll need:

- [AWS Account][free-tier]
- [AWS Command Line Interface][cli]
- [Google Chrome][chrome]
- [git][git]
- Text editor

### Labs

#### Lab 1: Static Website Hosting

In this module, you'll setup an Amazon S3 bucket to host your assets and configure it to serve a static website. Because Wild Rydes is a startup preparing for global scale you'll also configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution to accelerate delivery of your assets to your potential users across the world.

#### Lab 2: Beta Sign-up Mailing List

Visitors to your website who are interested in participating in your beta program can enroll by filling out a form to join your beta users mailing list. You'll create an Amazon DynamoDB table to store these email addresses and an Amazon Cognito identity pool and an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to allow unauthenticated users to post it. Using DynamoDB Streams, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SES, beta users will receive a confirmation email thanking them for enrolling and providing further details.

#### Lab 3: Administrative Interface

Your marketing team needs an administrative interface to manage aspects of the site. In this module, you'll create an Amazon Cognito user pool for your administrator users and start building endpoints in Amazon API Gateway. You'll configure an authorizer to validate the identity of your administrators and wire up a page to view users who have signed up for the beta program.

#### Lab 4: Product Update Blog

To keep your visitors up to date on your progress building your product, your marketing team would like to publish a blog of product updates. Using your new administrative interface, you'll add an interface to publish posts to the product update blog using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda which will appear on your landing page.

### Setup

1. Pick a single Region into which you'll deploy services. You'll need to ensure all required services (Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, Amazon SES, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon CloudFront, IAM) are available in the Region you choose. See the [Region Table][region-table] for details about what services are available in which Regions. [US East (N. Virginia)][us-east-1], [US West (Oregon)][us-west-2], and [EU (Ireland)][eu-west-1] offer all of the services required for this workshop. 

All of the resources created in the below labs must be created within a single Region.
   
1. Clone the lab contents locally.

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-website-workshop.git
   ```

   This repository contains files required for all four labs and a work directory for you to copy files into as you progress through the workshop.
   
1. Ensure your [installation][cli-installation] of the AWS CLI is properly [configured][cli-configuration] with credentials that have administrator access to your account.

### Tips

- Open a blank text editor file for scratch notes. Whenever a step instructs you to note an item, copy and paste that item into your scratch notes for later reference.

- Look for error messages in the [Google Chrome Developer Console][developer-console] if you encounter an issue with any of the functionality loading on the site. You can access the console by pressing **Control + Shift + J** on Linux and Windows or **Command + Option + J** on macOS.

- There are several components of the setup which are case sensitive (e.g. DynamoDB tables and keys). To avoid errors, prefer copying and pasting to re-typing.

## Lab 1: Static Website Hosting

In this module, you'll setup an Amazon S3 bucket to host your assets and configure it to serve a static website. Because Wild Rydes is a startup preparing for global scale you'll also configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution to accelerate delivery of your assets to your potential users across the world.

1. Select **S3** from the AWS Management Console.
1. Click the **Create Bucket** button.
1. Enter a name for the bucket in **Bucket Name**. Bucket names must be globally unique within AWS so prefix the name of the bucket with your last name to prevent collisions. For example, in our examples we'll follow the convention of **LAST_NAME-wildrydes** so we'll use **smith-wildrydes**.
1. Select the Region in which you'll use for this lab in the **Region** drop down. See the note in the requirements section about which Region to choose. US East (N. Virginia) is called US Standard in Amazon S3 for legacy reasons.
1. Click the **Create** button.

   ![Create Bucket](images/lab1_create-bucket.png)

1. Expand the **Permissions** section.
1. Click the **Add bucket policy** link.

   ![Bucket permissions](images/lab1_bucket-permissions.png)
 
1. Create a bucket policy to allow anonymous read access to your bucket. This will make the bucket content publicly readable and allow Amazon S3 to serve it to web users. Ensure that you change the **INSERT_BUCKET_NAME_HERE** placeholder to the name you chose in **Step 3**.

   ```json
	{
	  "Version": "2012-10-17",
	  "Statement": [
	    {
	      "Effect": "Allow",
	      "Principal": "*",
	      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
	      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::INSERT_BUCKET_NAME_HERE/*"
	    }
	  ]
	}
   ```
   
  ![Bucket policy](images/lab1_bucket-policy.png)
   
1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Expand the **Static Website Hosting** section.
1. Select **Enable website hosting**.
1. Enter **index.html** as the website's **Index Document**. This will redirect requests to the root of your website to the object **index.html**.
1. Note the hostname in **Endpoint**.

   ![Website hosting](images/lab1_website-hosting.png)

1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Copy the Wild Rydes static website files from `lab1/` to your work directory. The work directory will act as a staging area for  our static site while we build it. We'll be incrementally copying files from each lab-specific directory into it and editing them as we progress through the workshop.

  On Linux and macOS:

  ```console
  cp -R lab1/* work
  ```

  On Windows:

  ```console
  xcopy /E /Y lab1 work
  ```

1. Copy the Wild Rydes static website files into your bucket. Replace the **INSERT_BUCKET_NAME_HERE** placeholder with the bucket you created earlier.

   ```console
   aws s3 sync work/ s3://INSERT_BUCKET_NAME_HERE
   ```

1. Browse to the hostname that you noted above in **Step 13** and ensure that the website loads. Verify that the links work.

   ![Website](images/lab1_website.png)

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services** in the navigation bar and select **CloudFront**.
1. Click the **Create Distribution** button.
1. To create a web distribution, click the **Get Started** button under the **Web** header.
1. Enter the static hosting endpoint from the Amazon S3 bucket that you noted above in **Step 13** and browsed to in **Step 17** in **Origin Domain Name**. Ensure that you enter in the static website hosting endpoint and do not use the autocompleter as that option will configure traffic to use bucket rather than its website endpoint which cannot serve web pages correctly.

   ![Origin domain name](images/lab1_origin-domain-name.png)

1. Select **Customize** from **Object Caching**.
1. Enter **5** as the **Default TTL**. This will cache objects for 5 seconds before checking for file updates with the origin. In production, this value would be set much higher but we're lowering it to 5 for demonstration purposes during the workshop.

   ![Customize cache settings](images/lab1_customize-cache-settings.png)

1. Click the **Create Distribution** button.
1. Wait for the **Status** field to change from **In Progress** to **Deployed**. This may take a few minutes to provision so take a break or skip to the first few steps of Lab 2 while this is in progress.

   ![CloudFront distributions](images/lab1_cloudfront-distributions.png)

1. Once deployed, test your CloudFront distribution by putting the **Domain Name** of your distribution into a web browser. Click around and verify that the site works as it did in **Step 17**.

   ![Website via CloudFront](images/lab1_website-via-cloudfront.png)

***LAB 1 COMPLETE***

In this lab you've:

- Created an Amazon S3 bucket
- Configured it for static web site hosting
- Created a Amazon CloudFront distribution to deliver your content around the world

## Lab 2: Beta Sign-up Mailing List

Visitors to your website who are interested in participating in your beta program can enroll by filling out a form to join your beta users mailing list. You'll create an Amazon DynamoDB table to store these email addresses and an Amazon Cognito identity pool and an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to allow unauthenticated users to post it. Using DynamoDB Streams, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SES, beta users will receive a confirmation email thanking them for enrolling and providing further details.

1. Select **SES** from the AWS Management Console.
1. Click **Email Addresses** in the left hand navigation menu.
1. Click the **Verify a New Email Address** button.
1. Enter an email address where you can receive email in **Email Address**. By default, Amazon SES operates in sandbox mode which means that you must verify all email addresses used to send and receive email. This is useful for development and demonstration purposes. The email address you enter here must be able to receive emails and we'll also use it as the sender in our workshop.
1. Click the **Verify this Email Address** button.
1. Click the **Close** button.
1. Wait for the verification email from Amazon SES to arrive in the inbox of the email address you provided in **Step 4**.

    }
    ```

1. Enter the **Invoke URL** from the API you noted in **Step 84** as the **apiUrl** attribute.

    For example:

    ```javascript
    var Wildrydes = {
      config: {
        region: 'us-east-1',
        identityPoolId: 'us-east-1:ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff',
        userPoolId: 'us-east-1_0Vt8rntSI',
        userPoolClientId: 'jc2f4p2ft4r7mmbeg9s3c8vtq',
        apiUrl: 'https://aaaaaaaaaaaa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod',
      }
    }
    ```

1. Update the contents of the Amazon S3 bucket created in Lab 1 with the new files:

   ```console
   aws s3 sync work/ s3://INSERT_BUCKET_NAME_HERE
   ```

1. Open your web browser and open the admin page of the Wild Rydes marketing site using the CloudFront URL you created in Lab 1 and append **/admin** to it.

    ![Admin](./images/lab3_admin.png)

1. Click on the **View Emails** link.
1. Verify that you see a full list of emails that have been submitted to the site. Submit other email addresses and reload this page to ensure they are also returned.

***LAB 3 COMPLETE***

In this lab you've:

- Created an Amazon Cognito user pool to manage identities for your administrator users.
- Created an Amazon DynamoDB function to return email addresses through a Amazon API Gateway proxy to an AWS Lambda method.
- Added an API for our site and added an emails resource with a GET method only accessible to authenticated administrator users.

## Lab 4: Product Update Blog

To keep your visitors up to date on your progress building your product, your marketing team would like to publish a blog of product updates.
